Commonly used in Linux to monitor system memory, disk usage, and directory sizes.

 Here's a breakdown of each:

1. Check Free Memory: free -m
This command shows the system's memory usage in megabytes (-m flag). Example output:

$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7964        4512         723         201        2728        3012
Swap:          2048         512        1536
total → Total available RAM
used → RAM currently in use
free → Free RAM available for use
shared → Memory shared between processes
buff/cache → Memory used for disk caching and buffering
available → Estimated memory available for new processes
Swap → Virtual memory usage (if RAM is full, swap is used)

2. Check Disk Usage: df -kh
This command shows disk space usage (df), with:

-k → Display sizes in KB (default)
-h → Human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB, TB)
Example output:
$ df -kh
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       50G   20G   30G  40% /
tmpfs           4G    512M  3.5G  10% /dev/shm
/dev/sdb1       200G  150G  50G  75% /mnt/data

Filesystem → Disk or partition name
Size → Total space
Used → Space used
Avail → Available space
Use% → Usage percentage
Mounted on → Mount point (where the filesystem is accessed)

3. Check Directory Size: du -sh *
This command calculates the size of each directory in the current location:

du → Disk usage
-s → Summarize, show only the total size of each directory
-h → Human-readable format (MB, GB)
* → All files and folders in the current directory

Example output:

$ du -sh *
2.3G    logs
1.1G    backups
500M    reports
logs → 2.3 GB
backups → 1.1 GB
reports → 500 MB

Common Use Cases

✅ Check memory usage before running a heavy application:

free -m

✅ Monitor disk space and avoid full partitions:

df -kh

✅ Find large directories consuming space:

du -sh * | sort -h
