In Linux, file and folder permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

Owner (User)
Group
Others (Everyone else)
Viewing Permissions
You can check file/folder permissions using:

ls -l
Example output:

-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Feb 18 12:00 file.txt

Explanation:

-rw-r--r-- → File permissions
1 → Hard link count
user → File owner
group → File group
1234 → File size in bytes
Feb 18 12:00 → Last modified date
file.txt → File name


Understanding Permission Structure

[Type] [Owner] [Group] [Others]
- rw- r-- r--
First character (- or d):

- → Regular file
d → Directory
l → Symbolic link

Next nine characters: Three sets of three permissions (rwx for owner, group, and others).

r → Read (4)
w → Write (2)
x → Execute (1)
- → No permission
Example breakdown (-rw-r--r--):

rw- → Owner (Read, Write)
r-- → Group (Read)
r-- → Others (Read)
Changing Permissions
Using chmod (Change Mode)

Symbolic Method


chmod u+x file.txt  # Add execute permission for user
chmod g-w file.txt  # Remove write permission for group
chmod o+r file.txt  # Add read permission for others
chmod a+rwx file.txt  # Give read, write, execute to all (user, group, others)
Numeric Method (Octal)


chmod 754 file.txt
7 (Owner: rwx → 4+2+1 = 7)
5 (Group: r-x → 4+0+1 = 5)
4 (Others: r-- → 4+0+0 = 4)
Using chown (Change Owner)


Recursive Permission Change
To apply permissions recursively to all files and subdirectories:


chmod -R 755 folder/
chown -R user:group folder/
